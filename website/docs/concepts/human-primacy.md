# Human Primacy

The foundational principle of DialAI is that **the human is always right**. This is not a claim about human infallibility. It is a claim about context.

## Context Asymmetry

An AI model operates on a bounded context window — thousands or millions of tokens. A human operates on a lifetime of embodied experience, tacit knowledge, institutional context, and real-time sensory input that no model has access to.

The human knows things they cannot tell the machine. The machine, trained on human works and operating on a compressed subset of human knowledge, cannot determine when the human is wrong — because what looks like an error from the AI's limited vantage point may reflect context the AI simply doesn't have.

## The Specialist's Role

A DialAI specialist is not an authority. It is a participant in a system designed to measure whether its participation adds value. It adds value by being cheaper and faster at decisions where the required context fits within its window. Being *better* than a human on some subjective basis is not the goal.

The specialist will be judged on alignment with the human, and that judgment is correct, because the human's broader context makes the human's decision the more reliable one.

## When Humans Disagree

If the human is always right, and there is more than one human, then humans can disagree — but even in disagreement they are both right, compared to an AI. An AI has no standing to break the tie. Human disagreement is resolved by human mechanisms: negotiation, authority, voting among humans. The AI's role is to predict what the humans would collectively choose, not to adjudicate between them.

## The Value of AI

The value proposition of AI is not superiority but efficiency. AI is faster and cheaper at narrow tasks where the required context fits within the model's window. DialAI's purpose is to discover — empirically and with precise cost data — which decisions are narrow enough for AI to handle, and what the ongoing human quality-control cost is to maintain that delegation over time.
